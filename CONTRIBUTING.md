## Project Goals

We are building a *Healthcare Payments & Analytics* software suite on the blockchain to **help hospitals improve patient outcomes, and to help insurers eliminate fraud with our Ai Workbench, while helping banks to quickly and easily search for a healthcare practice that they will want to loan money to by accessing our underwriting data**. Our application includes a backend API service to handle basic CRUD operations and is built on a **DARN** technology stack that includes the following tools:

* DynamoDB
* AWS Serverless Lambda
* React.js
* Node.js (Python for Utilities & Analytics)

Our goal is to make **SpecTruMetRx** a trusted healthcare software service partner for Healthcare practices around the world by building a secure and HIPAA compliant *Progressive Web Application* (PWA) to target every device on the market. We want to be the most accessible and practical healthcare payments network on the market. We will deploy our services to fulfill the needs of the following healthcare practice types:

* Behavior Analyst Practices
* Dental Clinics
* Physical & Occupational Therapy Clinics
* Urgent Care Centers & Hospitals
